# EVA_MIlab_Hackathon

## Task
Your task is to train a deep reinforcement learning agent in the OpenAI-Gym "Car Racing" environment (https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/car_racing/).

The goal is to come up with your best performing agent and see how it compares to the other Hackathon teams!

- try different algorithms: DQN, AC, DDPG, ...
  (you are strongly encouraged to develop your own implementations, not just use examples found on github or provided ones from "OpenAI Baselines". But of course, you can get use them as inspiration, starting points or benchmarks.)
- You should study and try to improve the agent in detail (e.g. vary hyperparameters, network architecture etc.)
- You should measure and evaluate performance (Reward vs training episodes etc.), do numerical comparisons, charts, diagrams etc.

## Formalities
The hackathon will be developed in teams. 
- Timeframe: Monday 10.2.2025 - Wednesday, 12.02.2025,
- Kick-off meeting: Monday 10.2.2025 10h00
- Final team presentations and Q&A: Wednesday, 12.02.2025, 16:30-18:00.

Presentation format:  20 minutes per team, plus 10 minutes Q&A). All team members are expected to present. The presentation should contain: Methodology, Results, Code Overview, & brief demo. Part of the demo can be presented during the Q&A section.
